I created a repository for the sake of a CTI110 class that requires me to place my name on the internet to dox this account.
After downloading Github Desktop, I opened the progam and selected "Show in Explorer" to view the ReadMe.
This file uses a .md extension type that CTI110 did not teach us about best practice for editing. With my prior knowledge before this class, I downloaded NotePad++ to edit this file natively on Windows.
