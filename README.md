I created a repository for the sake of a CTI110 class that requires me to place my name on the internet as identification.
After downloading Github Desktop, I opened the progam and selected "Show in Explorer" to view the ReadMe.
This file uses a .md extension type that I have not been taught for about best practice for editing. With my prior knowledge before this class, I downloaded NotePad++ to edit this file natively on Windows for use.
